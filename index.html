    <h1><code>Hello World!</code></h1>
    <p>
        My name is Bram Banik and I'm a third-year engineering physics student at the University of British Columbia.  I'm particularly interest
        in the field of circuit design and  Edge AI applications. In my spare time, I manage the aerodynamics subteam of UBC Thunderbikes. My weekends
        are filled with simulations and carbon fiber wet layups! Feel free to check out the 'Projects' tab of my website to see what I'm up to. I'll 
        also be posting occasional blogs to keep a little logbook of my university experience!

    <h2>What is Engineering Physics?</h2>
    <p>
        Engineering Physics is one of the most unique and competitive programs. Combining aspects of software, electrical and mechanical engineering, there is a
        heavy emphasis on applicable design.  The program is designed to integrate these aspects of engineering and provides avenues for students to develop their 
        own devices, products, and on the grander scale, careers!
