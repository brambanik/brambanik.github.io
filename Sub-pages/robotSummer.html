        <h1>ENPH253 Robot Summer: Big Dawg</h1>
        <h2>Sunday, August 10, 2025</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Many Engineering Physics students look forward to the summer of their second year in university, and for good reason. 
            It marks the beginning of a rigorous yet friendly competition coloquially known as "Robot Summer."
            Teams of four compete to design a robot that autonomously navigates a course that changes every year. This 
            year, the theme was Pet Rescue! Pets (represented by beanie babies) are trapped in a burning building and it's our 
            job to save them!
        </p>
        <h3>Tackling the Design Challenge</h3>
        <p>Our team quickly realized there was a lot more to rescuing a pet than we had initially imagined. Not only did the robot had to drive along a line, it also had to
            be able to concurrently detect pets, determine distances, relay information to the claw, and of course actually pick up pets. This requires integration of the three 
            main branches of Engineering Physics: Software, Mechanical, and Electrical engineering. I was delegated to the majority of electrical and software work. As such, my first
            project was figuring out the circuit to drive the motors, which introduced my long debugging battle with one of the most infamous circuits: the H-Bridge.
        </p>
        <h3>H(ate)-Bridges: My Mortal Enemy</h3>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of an autonomous robot is the driving system. Without it, the robot can't really
            do anything of practical use. While it's possible that you could wire up a MOSFET with a PWM to the gate and change the speed
            of a motor, this only allows unidirectional rotation unless you physically flip the voltage leads. That's where the H-Bridge comes in:
            it allows you to spin a motor in both directions through PWM. 
        </p>

        <p>This was my first real foray into circuit design and using software like KiCad. The circuit shown here was designed by one of our instructors,
            which I drew up in KiCad. To make our robot cleaner and easier to debug, we decided to order PCBs, which meant I had to design 
            custom boards for all of our circuits. Shown below is the PCB design we ended up with, after a couple of revisions. One of the key aspects of this design
            is the spike-filtering capacitors and larger traces going to the motors. These are both to ensure smooth operation of the H-Bridge and 
            to avoid any possible blown wires.
