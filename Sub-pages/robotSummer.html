        <h1>ENPH253 Robot Summer: Big Dawg</h1>
        <h2>Sunday, August 10, 2025</h2>

        <p>
            Many Engineering Physics students look forward to the summer of their second year in university, and for good reason. 
            It marks the beginning of a rigorous yet friendly competition coloquially known as "Robot Summer."
            Teams of four compete to design a robot that autonomously navigates a course that changes every year. This 
            year, the theme was Pet Rescue! Pets (represented by beanie babies) are trapped in a burning building and it's our 
            job to save them!
        </p>
        <h3>Tackling the Design Challenge</h3>
        <p>Our team quickly realized there was a lot more to rescuing a pet than we had initially imagined. Not only did the robot had to drive along a line, it also had to
            be able to concurrently detect pets, determine distances, relay information to the claw, and of course actually pick up pets. This requires integration of the three 
            main branches of Engineering Physics: Software, Mechanical, and Electrical engineering. I was delegated to the majority of electrical and software work. As such, my first
            project was figuring out the circuit to drive the motors, which introduced my long debugging battle with one of the most infamous circuits: the H-Bridge.
